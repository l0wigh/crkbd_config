# Corne V4 Layout

This repo contain my layout(s) for AZERTY Coding. Using VIAL to flash them

## What compose this layout

There is 4 main layers :
- Default layer containing letters. Specials letters are accessed with tap dancing
- Coding layer containing most (if not all) the characters that are used in source code
    - They are mostly placed in a symetric way for better hands coordination.
- Numerical layer containing numbers and an utility variant of the same key with Shift being pressed
- Functions layer which contains FN keys, arrows, and some keyboard RGB configuration

## How to swap from layer to layer

Layers are placed in a circular way.

```
0 <-> 1 <-> 2 <-> 0
```

You might be thinking : Where is the fourth layer ?
Since it's not an important layer, it was made as a toggable one on the right thumb cluster.
It's also very useful to use arrow keys without switch layout entirely.

The way you should think of this layout is that you select the required layout do everthing you need in it and then go to the next desired layout.

## There is some missing informations !!!

Yeah I know, I'll try to bring some screenshots when I'll have a somewhat definitive layout.

## Will this change in the future ?

I might tweak how I use the keyboard in the future. I'm still thinking about other ways to use the layers in a more optimal way or a safer way. If massive changes happens I'll increment the major version of the keyboard. The README will be changed according to what I'm using at the time. Use the commit history to see how to use older version of the layout.

## Fix History

- V2.1
  - Fixing layer 2 for easier use of Fluorite
  - Switching from using LShft to RShft for special keys because of a utility on Windows
- V2.O
  - First proper version of the layout that is now able to be used for coding
- V1
  - Just a very basic AZERTY layout
